# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixes

- **Overscan crop preserves the aspect ratio** — Crop Overscan now removes
  3.75% from each edge. At 2x, a 640 x 480 game produces 1184 x 888,
  exactly 4:3, while still hiding Burnout 3's black border. RetroArch also
  receives an aspect ratio adjusted for the crop, avoiding distortion when
  crop sizes are rounded to whole pixels.

## linux-v0.17.0 (Linux, aarch64 and x86-64)

Adds an experimental AMD64 (x86-64) Linux core alongside the ARM64 build
used by PortareOS. Download the archive for your machine's architecture.

### What's new

- **AMD64 Linux core** — Runs Xbox code on Intel and AMD CPUs through
  KVM, sharing the ARM64 build's kernel, devices and Vulkan renderer.
  Requires Linux 5.16 or newer, access to `/dev/kvm`, TSC scaling and UMIP.
  See the [AMD64 installation guide](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/blob/linux-v0.17.0/README.md#play-on-amd64-x86-64-linux-systems)
  for virtualization setup, permissions and RetroArch installation.
- **Archives for both architectures** — Releases now include `aarch64`
  and `x86_64` archives, each with a SHA-256 checksum and `BUILD-INFO`.
  Publication waits for both architectures' build, regression and package
  checks to pass.
- **KVM regression coverage** — Checks CPU exits, thread state, memory
  faults, interrupts, Xbox clock timing and page protection across threads.
  The libretro harness also tests synthetic titles, graphics and repeated
  loading and unloading under KVM.
- **Comparing ARM64 and AMD64** — The testing guide covers using the
  same game, in-game saves and audio settings to investigate differences
  between FEX and KVM.

The KVM backend and core have automated test coverage on GitHub's Linux
runners. Real-game play and GPU driver compatibility on AMD64 still need
device validation. [Implementation](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/issues/56).

### Current limitations

- AMD64 uses linear audio resampling and defaults to Fast audio
  processing; the DSP JIT is available only on ARM64.
- Only one console behind the same router can use external UDP 3074.
  An upstream NAT, including carrier-grade NAT, may still block peers.
- Dashboard files are not included; install your own copy to use Start Core.
  Dashboard navigation and end-to-end Insignia setup still need device validation.
- Save states, rewind and run-ahead are unavailable. Transfer progress
  between architectures using in-game saves.
- XLink Kai and a general-purpose Internet (NAT) option are unavailable in
  RetroArch; NAT is used by the Insignia option.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.16.0 (PortareOS)

Adds UDP forwarding and automatic router port mapping for Xbox Live
(Insignia), allowing peers to reach the console before it sends to them.

### What's new

- **Insignia UDP forwarding** — Forwards the console's UDP 3074 through
  the device's UDP 3074. With **Network → Xbox Live (Insignia)** enabled,
  enable UPnP on the router or forward UDP 3074 to the device manually for
  Open NAT. If the device has a firewall, allow inbound UDP 3074.
- **Automatic router setup** — Discovers UPnP routers, requests a port
  forward, renews leases with retries and checks ownership before cleanup
  on shutdown. Supports routers that require permanent leases.
- **Fallbacks and diagnostics** — If UDP 3074 is busy, outgoing traffic
  uses a free port without automatic forwarding. Logs explain port
  conflicts, missing routers and upstream NAT. Advanced overrides are
  documented in the
  [NAT options](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/blob/linux-v0.16.0/native/README.linux.md#insignia-nat).
- **Network regression checks** — Adds tests using console Ethernet
  frames and a fake UPnP router for incoming traffic, busy ports, lease
  renewal, router replies and ownership checks during shutdown.

The merged code passed the Linux build, automated regression tests, package
verification, generated Vulkan shaders and save-state schema checks.
Real-router interoperability, dashboard navigation in RetroArch and
end-to-end Insignia registration, account setup and online play still need
device validation.
[Implementation and validation](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/pull/55).

### Current limitations

- Only one console behind the same router can use external UDP 3074.
  An upstream NAT, including carrier-grade NAT, may still block peers.
- Dashboard files are not included; install your own copy to use Start Core.
- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and a general-purpose Internet (NAT) option are unavailable in
  RetroArch; NAT is used by the Insignia option.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.15.0 (PortareOS)

Boot the Xbox dashboard from RetroArch to access its Xbox Live pages for
Insignia account setup.

### What's new

- **Xbox dashboard** — Select **Load Core → Microsoft - Xbox (hakuX) →
  Start Core** without loading a game. Copy your dashboard files
  (`xboxdash.xbe` and its folders) into `hdd/Partition2/` under RetroArch's
  save directory (`/storage/saves/xbox/hdd/Partition2/` on PortareOS).
  If the dashboard is missing, the core shows where to install it.
- **Dashboard restarts** — Supports resets, video driver rebuilds and
  navigation between the dashboard's main menu and Xbox Live pages.
  Process relaunches preserve the configuration and save directory,
  including when the core was loaded through RetroArch's menu.
- **Insignia guidance** — Prompts when a game has no Insignia account or
  the dashboard needs **Network → Xbox Live (Insignia)** enabled. Existing
  Insignia gamertags are listed in the log. Register the console with
  Insignia's Setup Assistant before creating an account in the dashboard.
- **Regression checks** — Adds dashboard boot, reset, game switching,
  relaunch and account-detection coverage. Includes the restart memory-check
  fix documented after 0.14.0.

The merged code passed the Linux build, automated regression tests, package
verification, generated Vulkan shaders and save-state schema checks.
Dashboard coverage uses synthetic executables in the libretro harness;
real RetroArch dashboard navigation and end-to-end Insignia registration,
account setup and sign-in still need device validation.
[Implementation and validation](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/pull/54).

### Current limitations

- Dashboard files are not included; install your own copy to use Start Core.
- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and a general-purpose Internet (NAT) option are unavailable in
  RetroArch; NAT is used by the Insignia option.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.14.0 (PortareOS)

Brings upstream hakuX 1.3.0's game fixes to RetroArch and adds an experimental
Xbox Live (Insignia) network option.

### What's new

- **Xbox Live (Insignia)** — Choose **Quick Menu → Core Options → Network →
  Xbox Live (Insignia)**, then restart the game. Register the console first
  with Insignia's Setup Assistant. If your provider blocks Insignia's DNS
  server, put an insigniaDNS server's IPv4 address in `insignia-dns.txt` in
  the save directory. Only the first address is used; a missing or invalid
  address falls back to Insignia's default DNS server.
- **Console drive timing** — Disc and hard-disk reads now take a little
  time, activating upstream's fix for Morrowind freezing when leaving a
  building.
- **Graphics and memory handling** — Imports upstream's render-target
  coherence fixes while retaining the fork's allocation checks, CHD
  support, graphics features and DSP audio.
- **Restarts** — Cleans up the new timer, networking and title-update
  resources when closing, resetting or switching games. Fixes a network
  receive wait that could keep most of a CPU core busy.

### Game fixes from upstream

- **Fable: The Lost Chapters** — Fixes black or noisy faces and arms.
- **Morrowind** — Fixes the inventory character's red background, black
  band and ghost copies after loading.
- **Halo 2** — Fixes striped fog and the light-blue view around the scope.
- **Munch's Oddysee** — Removes the dark box around character shadows.
- **Project Zero II (PAL), Amped 2, Burnout 2, Def Jam: Fight for NY and
  Soldier of Fortune II** — Fixes startup, loading and intro failures.
- **Double-S.T.E.A.L: The Second Clash and Touge R** — Fixes scene startup
  and black-screen rendering problems.

The Linux build, automated regression tests, package verification, generated
Vulkan shaders and save-state schema checks passed. These upstream game
fixes have not been verified on the Nova for this release. Insignia sign-in
and Setup Assistant registration remain untested.
[Implementation and validation](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/pull/53).

### Current limitations

- The Xbox dashboard cannot be booted from RetroArch yet. Creating or
  recovering an Insignia account requires the dashboard.
- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and a general-purpose Internet (NAT) option are unavailable in
  RetroArch; NAT is used by the Insignia option.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.13.0 (PortareOS)

Xbox reverb and other DSP effects now play through stereo output, enabled by
default and accelerated by a DSP56300 JIT on ARM64 Linux.

### What's new

- **Full DSP by default** — Runs the game's Xbox audio programs for reverb and
  other effects. Uses the DSP JIT automatically; no setting change is needed
  unless a previous build saved an explicit audio-processing preference.
- **Fast fallback** — If a game has audio or performance problems, choose
  **Quick Menu → Core Options → Audio Processing → Fast**, then restart the
  game. This restores the previous dry mix and uses less CPU.
- **Voice completion** — Rechecks released voices before notifying the game,
  preventing stale notifications when a voice has been locked, restarted or
  removed. Also optimizes the C interpreter retained for debugging and builds
  without the JIT.

On the Retroid Pocket Nova, paired replay of DOA3's captured audio programs used
**27% less DSP CPU time with the JIT** than the optimized interpreter
(0.483 → 0.351 CPU-seconds per audio-second). Seven silence, impulse and tone
recordings were byte-identical, including the stereo reverb response. A live
fight passed listening and control checks with no observed audio underruns.
[Implementation and validation](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/pull/52).

Full DSP remains experimental and costs more CPU than Fast. Please report the
game and scene if audio sounds wrong or performance regresses, and whether
switching to Fast helps.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.2 (PortareOS)

Corrects misplaced specular highlights from point and spot lights, including
character lighting during Dead or Alive 3's electrical-fence effect in X-Octagon.

Verified against original Xbox lighting-test captures and in DOA3 on the Retroid
Pocket Nova. [Matched before/after screenshots and test results](https://github.com/portare-ch/hakuX-lr/pull/51).

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Reverb and other Xbox DSP effects are missing from the default audio mix.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.1 (PortareOS)

Clearer core options and documentation. The emulator is unchanged from 0.12.0.

### What's changed

- **Core options** — Shorter, plainer descriptions in **Quick Menu → Core Options**. Options that apply at the next boot now say "Restart the game to apply", and RetroArch's message after changing one says the same.
- **Core information** — The description and notes RetroArch shows for the core are rewritten.
- **`BUILD-INFO`** — Links the source revision to the hakuX-lr repository.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Reverb and other Xbox DSP effects are missing from the default audio mix.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.0 (PortareOS)

Better stereo audio, a NEON-accelerated audio resampler, and broader graphics support. Replaces 0.11.0 and all 0.12.0 experimental builds.

### What's new

- **Stereo positioning** — Sounds keep their left/right placement, including 3D effects. Surround channels use the stereo downmix measured from Halo's audio programs, correcting rear sounds that were too loud.
- **Clearer audio with ARM NEON** — A new 32-tap sinc resampler preserves high frequencies in speech and effects and reduces aliasing in high-pitched sounds. It uses ARM NEON vector instructions. To use the lighter, previous resampler, choose **Quick Menu → Core Options → Audio Resampler → Linear**, then restart the game.
- **Fewer audio glitches** — Short sounds play to the end, new 3D sounds no longer inherit audio from a previous sound, and audio left over after a partial RetroArch write is queued instead of dropped.
- **More texture formats** — L16, V16U16, R6G5B5, R5G5B5A1, R4G4B4A4 and depth textures used by pixel shaders render instead of appearing white.
- **Clipping** — Supports exclusive and multiple clip windows used for split-screen, picture-in-picture and HUD masks.
- **Lighting and shaders** — More accurate spotlight falloff and specular highlights. Adds depth replacement (`texm3x2depth`), BRDF lookups and constant-eye specular reflections (`texm3x3spec`).

On the Nova, brief play sessions in Burnout 3 and Halo showed no graphics glitches. Halo ran at 30 fps with sinc resampling; audio processing used about 3% of one CPU core. The new stereo mix has been measured against Halo's audio programs, but still needs in-game listening tests.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Reverb and other Xbox DSP effects are missing from the default audio mix.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.0-exp.3 (PortareOS, experimental)

Clearer audio and complete playback of short sounds. Experimental; 0.11.0 remained stable at release.

### What's new

- **NEON sinc resampler** — Preserves high-frequency detail in speech and effects and reduces aliasing in high-pitched sounds. In tests with 22 kHz input, 10 kHz content was within 0.2 dB of its original level, compared with a 6 dB loss before. Choose **Quick Menu → Core Options → Audio Resampler → Linear** for the previous resampler, then restart the game.
- **Complete short sounds** — Fixes lost audio at the end of non-looping sounds (2–3 ms) and very short effects disappearing at high pitch.
- Everything in 0.12.0-exp.2 below.

### Experimental

Sinc passed automated tests and device benchmarks; in-game listening tests were still pending. With 64 simultaneous sounds, it used about 5–9% of a frame on the Nova's big cores, two to three times the linear resampler. If audio sounds worse or crackles, try **Linear** and report the game.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.0-exp.2 (PortareOS, experimental)

Audio fixes alongside the graphics changes in 0.12.0-exp.1. Experimental; 0.11.0 remained stable at release.

### What's new

- **Stereo panning** — 2D sounds, including music and menu effects, keep their left/right balance instead of playing equally through both speakers.
- **Clean 3D sound starts** — New sounds no longer inherit audio from the previous sound using the same voice.
- **Audio buffering** — Queues samples RetroArch could not accept, fixing clicks and gaps caused by dropping about 17 ms of audio per partial write.
- Everything in 0.12.0-exp.1 below.

### Experimental

Automated tests passed; in-game listening tests were still pending. These changes may not fix quiet, off-centre audio in Halo and Ninja Gaiden Black: 3D sounds, surround channels and reverb are unchanged in this build. Report differences from 0.11.0 with the game and scene.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.12.0-exp.1 (PortareOS, experimental)

Broader Xbox GPU support, shipped in PortareOS for testing. Experimental; 0.11.0 remained stable at release.

### What's new

- **Texture formats** — L16, V16U16, R6G5B5, R5G5B5A1, R4G4B4A4 and depth textures used by pixel shaders render instead of appearing white.
- **Clipping** — Supports exclusive and multiple clip windows for split-screen, picture-in-picture and HUD masks.
- **Lighting** — Uses the Xbox lighting curve for spotlight falloff and specular highlights.
- **Pixel shaders** — Adds depth replacement (`texm3x2depth`), BRDF lookups and constant-eye specular reflections (`texm3x3spec`).

### Experimental

Based on NVIDIA documentation, xemu and available Xbox captures from nxdk_pgraph_tests. Brief Nova sessions in Burnout 3 and Halo showed no graphics glitches; other games were untested. Report regressions from 0.11.0 with the game and scene.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.11.0 (PortareOS)

System link: play a game's LAN mode with other devices on your network.

### What's new

- **System link (LAN)** — Enable **Quick Menu → Core Options → Network → LAN (system link)** on each device, then restart the game. Devices on the same Wi-Fi discover each other. Add peers on another subnet or a VPN to `lan-peers.txt` in the save directory. Off by default.
- **Duplicate console identities** — Detects devices sharing a copied hard disk identity and warns in RetroArch. A new identity is generated on the next game start; existing saves remain valid.

Verified two-way LAN traffic between Halo on the Nova and another computer. Multiplayer between two devices was still untested.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- XLink Kai and Internet (NAT) networking are unavailable in RetroArch.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.10.0 (PortareOS)

Fixes an NBA Inside Drive 2003 crash and nxdk startup, and adds antialiasing controls.

### What's new

- **NBA Inside Drive 2003** — Fixes a crash after the intro caused by an oversized framebuffer copy overwriting game code. Confirmed past the intro at full speed on the Nova.
- **Antialiasing controls** — Adds alpha-to-coverage and sample masks for effects such as foliage, fences and hair.
- **nxdk homebrew** — Programs built with the open-source Xbox SDK get past startup. nxdk_pgraph_tests completes, but its graphics still show a white screen.
- **Cache rebuild** — Graphics pipelines rebuild on first launch after updating, which may cause brief stutter.

Antialiasing controls follow register documentation for the NV2A's successor and pass automated tests and shader checks. In-game use, sample order and coverage patterns still need verification against an Xbox.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- NBA Inside Drive 2003 has blank saved player textures because GPU readback is incomplete.

## linux-v0.9.0 (PortareOS)

More of the Xbox GPU's texture and drawing features.

### What's new

- **Anisotropic filtering** — Textures a game filters anisotropically, such as floors and roads seen at an angle, are filtered at the game's degree (2x to 8x, up to what the GPU supports) instead of blurring.
- **Two-sided lighting** — Lit geometry drawn with both sides visible, such as foliage, cloth and flags, gets its own lighting on the back faces instead of the front's.
- **Colour key** — Textures keyed by a colour, such as sprites, no longer show that colour: matching texels become transparent, black, or are not drawn, as the game chooses.
- **Line width** — Lines, such as HUDs, radars and beams, are as wide as the game asks, scaled with the render scale. At 2x they were half as thick as on an Xbox.
- **Dithering** — Games that dither into 16-bit images are dithered, so skies, fog and gradients there no longer show bands.
- **Quincunx and gaussian filters** — Textures read through the Xbox's convolution filters, used by D3D's quincunx and gaussian antialiasing and by blur effects, are filtered with those kernels instead of plainly.
- **Signed textures** — Texture channels a game reads as signed, such as the normal maps of bump lighting, are read as signed, so bumps are no longer flat or inverted.
- **First start after updating** — The GPU pipelines are built again once, so a game may stutter briefly the first time.

These follow the Xbox GPU's registers and its published hardware tests, and pass the build's tests and shader checks. They haven't been tried in games on the Nova yet. The dither pattern, the quincunx kernel and the exact signed range haven't been compared against an Xbox.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.8.0 (PortareOS)

Controller rumble and a sharper default picture.

### What's new

- **Rumble** — Enable **Quick Menu → Core Options → Rumble**; it applies immediately. Vibration stops when paused, closed or restarted. Adjust strength in **Settings → Input → Haptic Feedback/Vibration**.
- **2x render scale by default** — Most games render at 1280x960, with sharper text and edges. Overscan stays cropped to fill a 4:3 screen. Choose **1x** if a game runs slowly.

### Current limitations

- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.7.2 (PortareOS)

Every frame the game draws reaches RetroArch.

### What's fixed

- **Repeated and skipped frames** — Fixes frame timing with variable RetroArch delays, such as audio sync waits. On ROCKNIX, these delays reduced a 59.9 fps game to 47.5 displayed frames/s. Frame selection now uses the actual read time. PortareOS's settings were unaffected.

### Current limitations

- Controller rumble is unavailable.
- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.7.1 (PortareOS)

Sound after a game starts again in RetroArch.

### What's fixed

- **Sound after a restart** — After RetroArch's Restart, a video driver rebuild, or a game switching to another of its programs (Jade Empire after New Game), the game went on without sound. Each new boot now gets its audio output set up again. Reported, with the fix and a test, by the pocket-ui project.
- **Build image** — The pinned Debian image now has a Vulkan loader with Mesa's drivers and `llvm-strip-19`, so `linux-build.sh`'s checks and `linux-package.sh` run in it without extra packages.

### Current limitations

- Controller rumble is unavailable.
- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.7.0 (PortareOS)

Upstream hakuX 1.2.0, with game compatibility and sound fixes.

### What's new

- **Upstream hakuX 1.2.0** — Includes upstream fixes for Doom 3, Fatal Frame II, Silent Hill 2, Splinter Cell: Double Agent, Ultimate Spider-Man, Grand Theft Auto III, Super Monkey Ball Deluxe, Sega GT 2002, Project Gotham Racing 2 and Dungeons & Dragons Heroes. These game fixes have not been checked on the Nova in this release.
- **Sound** — Includes upstream's fixes for games freezing while they hold audio voices, or continuing to play a voice after stopping it.
- **Linux integration** — The new network and Ethernet controller threads stop with the game, so closing, restarting and loading another game release their resources. Upstream's controller updates use the same hot-plugging state as RetroArch's ports.
- **Getting started** — The README covers installation, game formats, controls and troubleshooting on PortareOS and other ARM64 Linux systems.

### Current limitations

- Controller rumble is unavailable.
- Save states are not yet available.
- Networking is off; RetroArch network settings are not available in this release.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.6.0 (PortareOS)

CHD disc images in the RetroArch core.

### What's new

- **CHD disc images** — Games can be `.chd` files made with `chdman createdvd` from an `.iso` image. The core reads them in place, without unpacking them. A CHD takes about a third less space than its `.iso` (Burnout 3: 2.48 GB to 1.49 GB), and the game runs from it as fast as from the `.iso`.

### Fixed

- **Discs that can't be read** — When a game's disc image can't be read, the core closes its file once, not a second time when the game stops.

### Current limitations

- Controller rumble is unavailable.
- Save states are not yet available.
- CD CHDs and CHDs that require a parent image are unsupported. Use `chdman createdvd`.
- Full disc dumps (Redump), as ISO or CHD, are untested with real games.

## linux-v0.5.0 (PortareOS)

Players 2-4 in the RetroArch core.

### What's new

- **Players 2-4** — RetroArch's ports 1-4 are players 1-4: a second controller plays as player 2, and so on up to four. Each port has a controller plugged in unless its Device Type (Quick Menu → Controls → Port N Controls) is None.
- **Plugging in and out** — Changing a port's Device Type during the game plugs its controller in or pulls it out, and the game sees it as on a console: most games pause when player 1's controller goes. The ports stay so when the game restarts.

### Current limitations

- Controller rumble is unavailable.
- Save states are not yet available.
- Games must be `.iso` disc images.

## linux-v0.4.0 (PortareOS)

The RetroArch core stops and starts games inside RetroArch, and the Linux standalone is gone.

### What's new

- **Restart** — RetroArch's Restart starts the game again inside RetroArch.
- **Games that start another of their programs** — They continue inside RetroArch without restarting it.
- **Closing a game** — The core stops the game inside RetroArch. On PortareOS, RetroArch then returns to the launcher, as with every core; elsewhere it can load another game in the same session.
- **Video driver restarts** — If RetroArch restarts its video driver, the game starts again with a message, instead of RetroArch crashing.
- **No freeze on closing** — If stopping a game ever takes longer than 10 seconds, RetroArch closes instead of freezing.
- **Testing instructions** — [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) covers installing a release, logs and what to check, on PortareOS and on other ARM64 Linux systems.

### Removed

- **The Linux standalone `hakux`** — It wasn't tested, and PortareOS no longer used it. The release now holds only the RetroArch core.

### Current limitations

- Only player 1 is supported.
- Save states are not yet available.
- Games must be `.iso` disc images.

## linux-v0.3.0 (PortareOS)

Core options for the RetroArch core, and upstream hakuX 1.1.0.

### What's new

- **Core options** — RetroArch's Quick Menu has options for the render scale (1x to 4x) and the console's settings: screen format (widescreen games then show 16:9), language (RetroArch's by default) and video region. They take effect the next time the game starts.
- **Overscan crop option** — The border a TV hid is still cropped by default; turning the option off shows the whole picture, at once.
- **PAL games at 60 Hz** — European games that offer 60 Hz now run at it.
- **Upstream hakuX 1.1.0** — Includes upstream's emulator changes up to its version 1.1.0, mainly support for GPUs other than Adreno. Adreno GPUs, such as the Nova's, are unchanged.

### Current limitations

- Closing a game also closes RetroArch.
- Only player 1 is supported.
- Reset and save states are not yet available.
- Games must be XISO disc images with a `.iso` extension.

## linux-v0.2.1 (PortareOS)

Two fixes for the RetroArch core.

### What's fixed

- **Games that switch programs** — When a game starts another of its programs, RetroArch restarts on the same game and continues into it instead of returning to the launcher.
- **Video driver restarts** — If RetroArch restarts its video driver while a game is running, the game now closes and returns to the launcher, with a log entry, instead of possibly crashing.

### Current limitations

- Closing a game also closes RetroArch.
- Only player 1 is supported.
- Reset, core settings and save states are not yet available.
- Games must be XISO disc images with a `.iso` extension.

## linux-v0.2.0 (PortareOS)

Play Xbox games through RetroArch on PortareOS (Retroid Pocket Nova).

### What's new

- **RetroArch support** — Run hakuX as a RetroArch core, with access to RetroArch's menu, hotkeys and controller remapping.
- **Display timing** — RetroArch handles when frames appear on screen, including variable refresh rates and compensation for low frame rates. Graphics stay on the GPU throughout.
- **Xbox timing** — Matches the original Xbox's 59.94 Hz video timing and keeps audio in sync.
- **4:3 display** — Removes the border normally hidden by a TV, so standard-definition games fill a 4:3 screen.
- **Game saves** — Stores the emulated Xbox hard drive in RetroArch's save folder (`/storage/saves/xbox` on PortareOS).
- **Performance logs** — Optional logs show frame rates, frame delivery delays and the core's processing time per frame. Enable them with `HAKUX_DISP_STATS` and `HAKUX_LR_STATS`.

### Current limitations

- Closing a game also closes RetroArch.
- Only player 1 is supported.
- Reset, core settings and save states are not yet available.
- Games must be XISO disc images with a `.iso` extension.

## linux-v0.1.0 (PortareOS)

The first standalone hakuX release for PortareOS on the Retroid Pocket Nova, replacing xemu.

### What's new

- **Standalone emulator** — Play fullscreen with `hakux` on ARM64 Linux (glibc). A command-line version, `xboxrun`, is also available for testing without a display.
- **Audio** — Game audio plays through PipeWire.
- **Controllers** — All connected gamepads control player 1. Press **Home + Start** to quit.
- **PortareOS package** — Adds a script to create reproducible release archives for installation on PortareOS.

## v1.3.0

Xbox Live through Insignia, and game fixes.

### Xbox Live
- **Insignia** — Settings → Network → Connection → Xbox Live: Insignia connects the console to Insignia, the revival of the original Xbox Live: Live games sign in, find matches and play online. If your Internet provider blocks Insignia's DNS server, point it at a computer running insigniaDNS instead
- **Xbox Live setup** — Settings → Network → Xbox Live setup walks you through it, one step at a time: the connection, the Xbox dashboard, registering the console with Insignia's Setup Assistant (downloaded for you), then making or recovering your account in the dashboard
- **Dashboard** — the library's Dashboard button (top left) starts the Xbox dashboard from the console's hard disk, where Xbox Live accounts are made and recovered. The first time, it installs the dashboard from a zip of its files (dashboard 5960) that you provide: hakuX doesn't include one
- **Title updates** — a game's Xbox Live update, once downloaded, starts with the game. Forza Motorsport's 60 and 120 fps mods cover its update too

### Games
- **Fable: The Lost Chapters** — the hero's face and arms are no longer black or noise
- **Morrowind** — no longer freezes when you leave a building: disc and hard-disk reads now take a little time, as on the console. The inventory's character is drawn properly: it no longer stands on red with a black band over its head, or leaves ghost copies of itself around it when you change gear after a load
- **Halo 2** — the fog no longer shows as stripes that move with the camera, and with the scope up the view around it is dimmed with black lines, not light blue
- **Munch's Oddysee** — no dark box over the ground under the characters' shadows
- **Project Zero II (PAL)** — no longer hangs on its first frame
- **Amped 2** — no longer crashes as its first level loads
- **Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks** — the models no longer explode on Mali-G57 GPUs
- **Burnout 2: Point of Impact** — no longer crashes as it starts
- **Def Jam: Fight for NY** — no longer freezes on one frame at the intro cutscene: while hakuX holds a game up (such as while its shaders compile), the game's clock now waits too
- **Double-S.T.E.A.L: The Second Clash** — no longer stops as its first scene begins, and the screen is no longer black, also after loading a savestate
- **Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix** — no longer crashes when you skip an intro movie
- **Touge R** — races are no longer black under the HUD

### Performance
- **Network** — with the network on (system link or XLink Kai), the console no longer keeps most of a CPU core busy

### App
- **On-screen controls editor** — its toolbar wraps onto more rows on narrower screens, such as 4:3 handhelds, instead of pushing buttons off the edge

## v1.2.0

System link, stability and compatibility improvements.

### Network
- **System link over your network** — Settings → Network → System link → LAN: hakuX devices on the same Wi-Fi network find each other as Xbox consoles on a LAN do. Devices the network's broadcasts don't reach, on another subnet or a VPN such as ZeroTier or Tailscale, are added by address under Other consoles
- **XLink Kai** — system link over the Internet through an XLink Kai engine running on a computer on your network; its web page picks the game's arena
- **Console identity** — each console has its own serial number, network address and online key. A device whose hard disk was copied from another one offers to make itself a new identity, since two consoles with one identity can't see each other


### Games
- **Sega GT 2002** — the cars have their paint, reflections and sun highlights
- **Doom 3** — no longer crashes as its main menu loads
- **Fatal Frame II** — starts and reads its disc in the order it asks for
- **AirForce Delta Storm** — answers the controller and the on-screen controls (it ignored all input)
- **Silent Hill 2** — no longer crashes when it loads a room
- **Splinter Cell: Double Agent** — no longer closes on boot
- **Super Monkey Ball Deluxe** — its title movie plays and its movies aren't black
- **Ultimate Spider-Man** — no longer crashes a second into boot
- **Grand Theft Auto III** — no longer shows its bad-disc screen
- **Project Gotham Racing 2** — the attract replay no longer goes black
- **Dungeons & Dragons Heroes** — the tutorial's prompts show
- **Sound** — games that hold their voices while the sound engine updates them, or stop a voice as it changes, no longer freeze or play a stopped voice on

### Performance
- **Fewer stutters with Turnip** — frames reach the screen without a CPU wait in front of each one

### App
- **Controllers** — only the players with a controller are plugged into the console (player 1 always, for the on-screen controls), and a controller plugs in or out as it connects, disconnects or is assigned to another player, without restarting the game

## v1.1.0

GPUs beyond Adreno (experimental).

### GPUs
- **Mali, Xclipse and PowerVR (experimental)** — hakuX runs on GPUs other than Adreno: features they lack are replaced (BC and 4444 textures decoded up front, standard border colours, the push block in a buffer, D32S8 depth), and known driver bugs are worked around (`hw/xbox/hle/vk/quirks.c`). Burnout 3 and Mercenaries run cleanly on a Pixel 8 (Mali-G715)
- **Vulkan 1.1 drivers** — GPUs whose drivers stop at Vulkan 1.1 (Valhall Mali on older or vendor-capped drivers, Qualcomm's own older drivers, early Xclipse, PowerVR BXM) run through a compatibility layer (`hw/xbox/hle/vk/compat.c`)
- **Older GPUs without descriptor indexing (experimental)** — Bifrost Mali (G71, G72, G76, G52) and PowerVR Rogue: each draw binds its own textures, and depth is clamped in the shader where the GPU can't
- **Adreno** — unchanged: every replacement is off where the GPU has the feature.

### App
- **GPU driver** — a screen of its own (Settings → GPU driver): the system driver and the stored packages in one list, with their versions and authors. Packages are checked when added and can be deleted (deleting the one in use goes back to the system driver)
- **Turnip recommended** — a Qualcomm phone running its own driver older than Vulkan 1.3 suggests a Turnip driver once, from the library
- **Back key** — the device's back key opens the in-game menu, from any input, including the Retroid Pocket 5's own Back. A controller with both Back and Select keeps Back for the menu; on one without a Select key, Back is the Xbox Back button
- **Dark theme** — Settings → Display → App theme: the phone's, light or dark; the in-game menus follow it, in the app's green rather than Android's teal
- **Controller navigation** — the app works with a controller: the focused item stands out (a game is outlined in green), A selects, B goes back, and Y or Select opens a game's menu. The search field opens the keyboard only on A, the library has a refresh button, the mapping sliders move with left and right, release notes scroll, and X deletes a savestate from the in-game Load state list


## v1.0.0

A new core replaces xemu's QEMU-based one.

### New core
- **CPU** — the Xbox's x86 code runs on a FEX JIT (FEXCore fork), and the Xbox kernel is reimplemented natively (`native/kernel`): no QEMU
- **GPU** — the NV2A push buffer is decoded into Vulkan (HLE, `hw/xbox/hle`). Custom drivers (Turnip) load through adrenotools; driver-specific workarounds are quirks (`hw/xbox/hle/vk/quirks.c`, `debug.hakux.quirks`)
- **Audio** — the MCPX APU runs on the core's own services (`native/dev/apu`), out through AAudio
- **Savestates** — per game, in slots, with the hard disk's files
- **Mods and cheats** — per game, from `mods/` (library long-press "Mods & cheats"): XBE patches and replaced disc files; 60 and 120 fps mods for 13 games (`mods/README.md`, generators in `tools/mods`)
- **Controllers** — each physical controller routed to a player with its own mapping; the on-screen controller adds to player 1

### New features
- **Updates** — hakuX looks for a newer release on GitHub when it starts and on demand (Settings → Updates); one found shows its notes and installs from there
- **Frontends** — a game launched from ES-DE or another frontend returns to it when it closes
- **Console clock** — follows the phone's time and time zone, or a time set by hand (Settings → Console → Clock)
- **Start errors** — a game that can't start says why (the file can't be read, isn't an Xbox disc, or its program can't load) and goes back to the library
- **Mods** — Halo 2's 60 fps mod draws characters, vehicles and objects at 60; DOA2's 120 fps mod keeps the select screen's legend

### Performance
- **No pipeline-cache stutter** — each game keeps its own pipeline cache, written only after new compiles; the one shared by every game was rewritten every few seconds and froze the picture for 0.2–0.8 s (Ninja Gaiden Black)
- **Audio** — about 32 ms of latency instead of 128 ms, and less CPU for the sound engine
- **GPU emulation** — faster push-buffer decoding, texture unswizzling (NEON) and hashing, fewer lookups per draw
- **Savestates** — compressed on several threads (a Halo 2 save: 9.6 s to 3.9 s)
- **Idle frames** — the screen isn't redrawn when nothing changed, and the on-screen controller redraws only what changed
- **Disc reads** — a large read waits only its own thread, not the whole game
- **Library** — folders scanned in one pass (38 games: 270 ms to 63 ms)

### App
- **On-screen controller** — the menu button is a green dot
- **Large screens** — Android 16 keeps the landscape lock (the app is declared a game)
- **Storage** — JIT symbol maps left by earlier builds (gigabytes on some devices) are deleted at start
- **Backups** — hakuX's data is left out of Android's cloud backups and device transfers
- **Library** — savestate thumbnails and driver ZIPs load off the main thread

## v0.3.1

### New Features
- **Persistent log capture** — logs kept per session, rotated

### Improvements
- **Texture decompression** — S3TC decoded on several threads; 3D textures no longer use native BC (it corrupted BC3)
- **Surface eviction** — lazy, without a GPU finish per eviction, and no download for VRAM data that is never read
- **Texture cache** — no thrashing from an aggressive memory budget trim
- **Profiling** — all instrumentation behind `NV2A_PERF_LOG` (off by default)
- **XISO conversion** — extract-xiso replaces the Rust xdvdfs converter (no Rust/Cargo dependency)

## v0.3.0

### New Features
- **Per-game settings** — overrides per game in the settings UI
- **Xbox dashboard** — dashboard management, HDD tools, Insignia networking (NAT)
- **Texture dump and replacement**
- **Game compatibility quirks** — a per-game layer (Fable's cycle-breaker)
- **Debug log export** — from the settings
- **Skip boot animation** toggle

### Improvements
- **Vulkan** — native BC texture upload when the GPU has it, batched render sync, NEON blits, descriptor management without bindless textures
- **Vertex shaders** — the emulator stub replaced; uniform uploads optimized
- **Audio** — aligned with x1_box
- **Emulator process** — runs separately again (`:xemu`)
- **XISO** — the original ISO kept after conversion

### Bug Fixes
- Surface eviction VRAM corruption and stale texture sampling
- Vulkan pipeline exhaustion and eviction crashes
- A crash on a quick emulation restart (RCU)
- The 30 fps trap
- XISO conversion launching the original file when SAF renamed the output

## v0.2.1

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix HDD corruption** — restore block device flush on app terminate and background to persist QCOW2 metadata. Cache partition clear now uses synchronous writes
- **Fix game freeze on TB flush** — disable post-flush rewarm on Android which could hang on self-modified code
- **Fix TB cache prewarm crash** — disable startup prewarm on Android. Add build hash to tb_cache.bin for auto-invalidation on new builds
- **Fix on-screen controller hidden on some devices** — filter out virtual/internal devices (accelerometers, gyroscopes) that falsely report as gamepads

### Improvements
- **Simplified FPS overlay** — shows only FPS count
- **Unified log tags** — all logcat output uses hakuX prefix. Filter with: `adb logcat | grep hakuX`
- **HDD cache clear on background thread** — prevents ANR on large images

## v0.2.0

### New Features
- **OpenGL ES renderer** — experimental alternative to Vulkan, selectable in Graphics settings
- **EEPROM editor** — change Xbox language, video standard, resolution modes, aspect ratio, refresh rate
- **Settings index** — reorganized into 4 sections: hakuX Data, Graphics, Debug, EEPROM
- **System file pickers** — change MCPX ROM, Flash ROM, HDD image from settings
- **HDD export** — save a copy of the Xbox HDD to any folder
- **Games folder in settings** — moved from library screen to settings
- **Game search** — search bar with live filtering in game library
- **Pull-to-refresh** — swipe down to rescan games folder
- **XISO progress bar** — real progress tracking across copy/convert/save phases
- **XISO integrity check** — verifies XISO before launch, auto-rebuilds from ISO if corrupt

### Improvements
- **Controller overlay** — D-pad/stick repositioned, LS/RS as separate buttons, menu button, swipe-up gesture, trigger axis fix (-1.0 for release), per-pointer tracking
- **Pause menu** — actually pauses emulation, simplified UI
- **NEON optimizations** — S3TC decompression and texture swizzle (benefits both renderers)
- **XISO conversion** — staged in temp directory, clean up on interruption, write permission check
- **FPS overlay** — shows driver info or "OpenGL ES" label, frame pacing, shader stats
- **Clear code cache** button in Debug settings
- **Graceful VK texture LRU handling** — skip instead of crash when cache exhausted

### Bug Fixes
- Fix TB cache crash when FP settings change between sessions
- Fix pause/resume not working from in-game menu
- Fix GLES geometry shader crash (gl_PointSize unavailable without extension)
- Fix GLES shader version detection (was hardcoded to 320, now auto-detected)
- Fix shader link failure crash (graceful fallback instead of assert)
- Fix shared GLSL changes breaking VK (gated behind renderer check)

### Rebranding
- Package renamed to `com.rfandango.haku_x`
- Debug builds install alongside release (`com.rfandango.haku_x.debug`)

## v0.1.0

- Initial release
