 * hakuX native core — the VP's own stereo mix (MON_VP, the default without
 * the DSP) for 2D and 3D voices: a voice routed to the speakers is mixed
 * into the left and right speakers by its sends to the bins the guest's DSP
 * image puts on the speakers, each with its own gain, as that image does
 * for a stereo console: front left and right to their own speaker, the
 * centre to both at -3 dB, a back bin to its own side at -3 dB (the EP's
 * downmix), and the 3D bins (DirectSound's crosstalk bins, where the 3D
 * voices' HRTF submixes go) to the speaker bins of the same place, the
 * front pair at 0 dB, the back pair at -3 dB (the GP's crosstalk stage,
 * then the downmix). The LFE bin and the bins that aren't speakers (I3DL2
 * and the effect sends, the multipass bin) are the guest DSP program's,
 * whose effects this mix doesn't produce: they are left out of it.
 *
 * The route is a sound's, chosen once (vp.c): at its first frame with an
 * audible send, the speakers if one of them goes to a speaker bin, else
 * the monitor's existing mix (a voice sending only to the LFE or effect
 * bins, which would otherwise go silent), until its next VOICE_ON. Not
 * chosen again as its volumes change: a dry send fading to mute beside an
 * effect send fades the voice out, rather than switching it to the
 * monitor's mix with the effect send's level, and a dry send fading in
 * beside an effect send stays in the monitor's mix. Multipass groups keep
 * the monitor's mix.
 *
 * Bins 0 to 5 are DirectSound's speaker conventions (DSMIXBIN_FRONT_LEFT to
 * DSMIXBIN_BACK_RIGHT; Cxbx-Reloaded's XbDSoundTypes.h), not a rule of the
 * hardware's. The weights are the ones DirectSound's own DSP image uses for
 * a stereo console, measured in Halo (2026-10-30, with the full DSP): its
 * EP downmixes the speaker bins for the analog output by a 5x2 table in
 * its Y memory (Y:0000-0009, in AC-3's order L, C, R, Ls, Rs: 1 and 0,
 * 0.7071 and 0.7071, 0 and 1, 0.7071 and 0, 0 and 0.7071; no LFE), and
 * tones through each bin came out at 0 and -3.01 dB alike at 100 Hz, 1 kHz
 * and 8 kHz. Bins 6 to 9 the same way: the GP put a tone in bin 6, 7, 8 or
 * 9 into bin 0, 1, 4 or 5 at -0.03 dB, with a crosstalk-cancelling term on
 * the other side at -24.4 dB (at 1 kHz) that this mix leaves out. What the
 * hardware's analog stage and level do isn't measured.
 *
 * A send's source channel (vp_send_channel): a 2D voice's own channel, its
 * slot modulo the source's channels (vp.c mix_one_bin); a 3D voice's first
 * four slots, the VP's HRTF outputs, its HRTF filter's ears, the left ear
 * the first two and the right ear the last two. Those four go to the bins
 * the guest names with SET_HRTF_SUBMIXES, and DirectSound names them in the
 * order 6, 8, 7, 9: 3D front left, back left, front right, back right
 * (0x09070806 in both Dead or Alive 3 and The Thing), so each ear reaches
 * its own side's front and back bins. Taken as the even slots for the left
 * ear, the left ear went to front left and front right and the right ear
 * to both back bins: every 3D sound came out the same on both speakers.
 * Its destination is the bin it names; its headroom the shift the VP's
 * mix-bin path gives that send (vp.c).
